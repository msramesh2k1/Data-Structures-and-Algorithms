## Hey peeps üßë‚Äçüíª

Are you interested in solving DSA? But you feel hard

repo full of solutions.

![20220111_154505_0000](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/54928117/148924219-2480793e-83d1-4760-ac93-f0bbb9648fbd.jpg)

Here we'll be solving **Easy,Medium,Hard** DSA problems
using Java programming language.

## Why Java ??
Java is an object oriented language,It's easy to use, compile,
debug.It helps to reuse the code, nowadays most of the 
perks go with Java because it is 
1. Platform independent
2. Safe
3. Portable
4. High concurrency tool
5. Server side language

Last but not the least we can implement java for backend
development, Mobile application development.It also has its
own Virtual machine called **JVM**.

## How to contribute ?
If your very well versed at Java and DSA you can just head
over to the question you feel **Hard** to solve for the beginners
you can just drop out your solution
